## Introduction
In malaria, individuals are often infected with different parasite strains, with
the complexity of infection (COI) giving the number of genetically different
parasite strains in an individual. Changes in the mean COI in a population have
been shown to be informative of changes in transmission intensity with a number
of probabilistic likelihood and Bayesian models now developed to estimate COI.
However, rapid, direct measures based on heterozygosity or *FwS* have not been
directly related to the COI. In this package we present two new methods that use
easily calculated measures to directly estimate the COI from sequence read depth
data.

## Installation

::: .pkgdown-release
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install most recent released version
devtools::install_github("bailey-lab/coiaf@v0.1.0")
```
:::

::: .pkgdown-devel
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install development version
devtools::install_github("bailey-lab/coiaf")
```
:::

## Usage
Please consult the [example real data
vignette](https://github.com/bailey-lab/coiaf/blob/main/analysis/vignettes/example_real_data.Rmd)
for a primer on how to run real data using `coiaf`. For a description of how the
estimation methods work, please consult the [example coi prediction
vignette](https://github.com/bailey-lab/coiaf/blob/main/analysis/vignettes/example_coi_prediction.Rmd).

<!-- In order to run real data, please refer to the Articles drop down menu. Several -->
<!-- articles are provided which detail how the algorithm works, how data was  -->
<!-- simulated to test the algorithm, and importantly how to run real data. -->
<!-- A short example on running real data is included and outlines the necessary -->
<!-- data structure as well as the commands to run. -->

### Development
Please note that this package is still under development and may be missing
features.
