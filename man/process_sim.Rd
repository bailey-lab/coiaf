\title{Process simulated data}
\usage{
process_sim(sim, seq_error = 0.01, cut = seq(0, 0.5, 0.01), coi_method = "1")
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{Output of \code{\link[=sim_biallelic]{sim_biallelic()}}.}

\item{seq_error}{The level of sequencing error that is assumed.}

\item{cut}{How often the data is summarized.}

\item{coi_method}{The method we will use to calculate the theoretical COI.
The method is either "1" or "2". The default value is "1".}
}
\value{
Simulated COI curve.
}
\description{
Generate the simulated COI curve.
}
\details{
Utilize the output of \code{\link[=sim_biallelic]{sim_biallelic()}}, which creates simulated
data. The PLAF is kept, and the function computes whether a SNP is a
variant site or not, based on the simulated WSAF at that SNP. This process
additionally accounts for potential sequencing error. To check whether the
simulated WSAF correctly indicated a variant site or not, the phased
haplotype of the parasites is computed.
