# Introduction
In malaria infections, individuals can often be infected by multiple parasites due to repeated mosquito bites or mosquitoes harboring multiple parasites. Such mixed infections may represent unrelated strains or parasites that are related. The number of strains found in an individual is known as the Complexity Of Infection (COI). Previous methods have utilized statistics to determine the relative COI based on the assumption that parasites are unrelated. While such assumptions often do not hold, these methods provide insight into the force of infection and the parasite population. Prior methods have been proposed to measure COI, including probabilistic likelihood models and Bayesian models. However, a rapid direct measure such as heterozygosity or FwS has not yet been developed. Here we present two measures that show equivalent power to other methods, but are directly calculable from allele observed proportions based on the knowledge of overall population allele frequencies.  

# Installation
To install the package, please follow the code below. In order to install,
devtools must be installed.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/OJWatson/coiaf")
```

# Usage
In order to run real data, please refer to the analysis folder. 
More specifically, the script that is titled, `real_mccoil_data.Rmd` provides
a comprehensive set of instructions on how to run real data. For questions
regarding documentation, please refer to the [online package website](ojwatson.github.io/coiaf/).

## Development
Please note that this package is still under development and may be missing 
features. This `README` will be updated as the package is developed accordingly.
