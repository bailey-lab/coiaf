\title{Simulate biallelic data}
\usage{
sim_biallelic(
  COI = 3,
  PLAF = runif(10, 0, 0.5),
  coverage = 200,
  alpha = 1,
  overdispersion = 0,
  epsilon = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{COI}{Complexity of infection.}

\item{PLAF}{Vector of population-level allele frequencies at each locus.}

\item{coverage}{Coverage at each locus. If a single value then the same
coverage is applied over all loci.}

\item{alpha}{Shape parameter of the symmetric Dirichlet prior on strain
proportions.}

\item{overdispersion}{The extent to which counts are over-dispersed relative
to the binomial distribution. Counts are Beta-binomially distributed, with
the beta distribution having shape parameters
\mjseqn{\frac{p}{\text{overdispersion}}} and
\mjseqn{\frac{1-p}{\text{overdispersion}}}.}

\item{epsilon}{The probability of a single read being miscalled as the other
allele. Applies in both directions.}
}
\value{
A list of:
\itemize{
\item \code{COI}: The COI used to simulate the data.
\item \code{strain_proportions}: The strain proportion of each strain.
\item \code{phased}: The phased haplotype.
\item \code{data}: A dataframe of:
\itemize{
\item \code{PLAF}: Population-level allele frequency.
\item \code{coverage}: The coverage at each locus.
\item \code{counts}: The count at each locus.
\item \code{WSAF}: The within-sample allele frequency.

\description{
Simulate biallelic data from a simple statistical model. Inputs
include the complexity of infection (COI), population-level allele
frequencies (PLAF), and some parameters dictating skew and error
distributions. Outputs include the phased haplotypes and the unphased read
count and coverage data.

\details{
\loadmathjax
Simulated data are drawn from a simple statistical model:
\enumerate{
\item Strain proportions are drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet
distribution with shape parameter \code{alpha}.
\item Phased haplotypes are drawn at every locus, one for each
\code{COI}. The allele at each locus is drawn from a Bernoulli
distribution with probability given by the \code{PLAF}.
\item The "true" within-sample allele frequency at every locus is
obtained by multiplying haplotypes by their strain proportions, and
summing over haplotypes. Errors are introduced through the equation
\mjsdeqn{\text{wsaf}_{\text{error}} = \text{wsaf}(1-e) + (1-\text{wsaf})e}
where \mjseqn{\text{wsaf}} is the WSAF without error and \mjseqn{e} is
the error parameter \code{epsilon}.
\item Final read counts are drawn from a beta-binomial distribution with
expectation \mjseqn{w_{error}}. The raw number of draws is given by the
\code{coverage}, and the skew of the distribution is given by the
\code{overdispersion} parameter. If the \code{overdispersion} is equal to
zero, then the distribution is binomial, rather than beta-binomial.
